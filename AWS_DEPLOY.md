# AWS Deployment Steps using Elastic Beanstalk

This document describes how to deploy your Dockerized application (backend and frontend) to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk with a multi-container Docker environment.

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS credentials.
- Elastic Beanstalk CLI (`eb`) installed.
- Your project contains the following files in the root directory:
  - `Dockerfile.backend`
  - `Dockerfile.frontend`
  - `Dockerrun.aws.json`

## 1. Create and Configure ECR Repositories

Before deploying, you'll need to push your Docker images to Amazon ECR.

### Steps:

1. **Create ECR Repositories:**
   Go to the AWS Management Console or use the AWS CLI to create two repositories (one for backend and one for frontend).

2. **Authenticate Docker to ECR:**
   Replace `YOUR_REGION` and `YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` with your actual values:
   ```bash
   aws ecr get-login-password --region YOUR_REGION | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.YOUR_REGION.amazonaws.com
   ```

3. **Build Docker Images Locally:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t your-backend-image -f Dockerfile.backend .
   docker build -t your-frontend-image -f Dockerfile.frontend .
   ```

4. **Tag the Docker Images:**
   ```bash
   docker tag your-backend-image:latest YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.YOUR_REGION.amazonaws.com/backend-repo:latest
   docker tag your-frontend-image:latest YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.YOUR_REGION.amazonaws.com/frontend-repo:latest
   ```

5. **Push the Images to ECR:**
   ```bash
   docker push YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.YOUR_REGION.amazonaws.com/backend-repo:latest
   docker push YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.YOUR_REGION.amazonaws.com/frontend-repo:latest
   ```

## 2. Configure the Dockerrun.aws.json File

Ensure your `Dockerrun.aws.json` file at the root of your project looks similar to the following. Replace placeholders with your actual details:

```json
{
  "AWSEBDockerrunVersion": 2,
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "backend",
      "image": "YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.YOUR_REGION.amazonaws.com/backend-repo:latest",
      "essential": true,
      "memory": 512,
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "hostPort": 8000,
          "containerPort": 8000
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "frontend",
      "image": "YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.YOUR_REGION.amazonaws.com/frontend-repo:latest",
      "essential": true,
      "memory": 256,
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "hostPort": 80,
          "containerPort": 3000
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 3. Create and Deploy Your Elastic Beanstalk Application

### Steps:

1. **Initialize Your Elastic Beanstalk Application:**
   In the root directory of your project, run:
   ```bash
   eb init -p docker seven-cells-app --region YOUR_REGION
   ```
   Replace `seven-cells-app` with your desired application name.

2. **Create an Elastic Beanstalk Environment:**
   Create an environment (e.g., "production") with:
   ```bash
   eb create seven-cells-env
   ```
   This command will deploy your application using the `Dockerrun.aws.json` configuration.

3. **Deploy Updates:**
   After the environment is set up, you can deploy future updates by running:
   ```bash
   eb deploy
   ```

4. **Monitor Your Environment:**
   Use the following command to monitor logs:
   ```bash
   eb logs
   ```
   And to open your application in a browser:
   ```bash
   eb open
   ```

## 4. Update Security Groups and Load Balancer Settings (if needed)

- Make sure that the security groups associated with your Elastic Beanstalk environment allow inbound traffic on the required ports (80 for the frontend and 8000 for the backend).
- You might also need to adjust settings in the Elastic Beanstalk console for the load balancer depending on your application's needs.

## Notes

- This guide assumes a multi-container Docker setup using Elastic Beanstalk.
- Tailor the memory allocations and ports based on your application's actual requirements.
- For production environments, consider further configuration such as environment variables, autoscaling, and logging.

By following these steps, you'll have your application deployed and running on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
